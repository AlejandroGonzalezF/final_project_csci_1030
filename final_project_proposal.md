1. Are you working alone or with someone else? If working with someone please put their name.
What is your plan for working on this? How much time do you plan to dedicate to working on your project? If working with a partner, how will you coordinate to work on the project?

*I'll work on my own, I plan to put 2-4 hours a week into developing my project.*

2. What dataset are you going to use (you can select more or less anything not already used in class or homework)? 

*I'm going to use vgsales.csv, a video game sales dataset.*

3. What is your starting hypothesis about the data? Create a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis as follows:

Null: *For the dataset vgsales.csv, the genre, publisher, platform, and year of release of a game does not impact whether or not it has high sales* 

Alternative: *For the dataset vgsales.csv, the genre, publisher, platform, and year of release of a game impacts whether or not it has high sales*

4. What models do you plan to apply to your data first? 

*Logistic Regression: Multiple of my columns are binary, and the coefficient provided will give insight for whether sales are impacted or not, which is helpful for my hypotesis.*

*Decision Trees: I consider it to be a simple way of getting the nonlinear relationships and determine links between two columns that may have not been well defined in the Logistic Regression coefficients.*

*Random Forest: I plan to use this as a follow up to the Decision Trees, to get an overall view of which factors are related to sales. And to see if it impacts or not the overall sales.*
