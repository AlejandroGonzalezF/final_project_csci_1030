1. Are you working alone or with someone else? If working with someone please put their name.
What is your plan for working on this? How much time do you plan to dedicate to working on your project? If working with a partner, how will you coordinate to work on the project?

*I'll work on my own, I plan to put 2-4 hours a week into developing my project.*

2. What dataset are you going to use (you can select more or less anything not already used in class or homework)? 

*I'm going to use vgsales.csv, a video game sales dataset.*

3. What is your starting hypothesis about the data? Create a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis as follows:

Null: *For the dataset vgsales.csv, the genre of a game does not impact whether or not it has high sales*
Alternative: *For the dataset vgsales.csv, the genre of a game impacts whether or not it has high sales*

4. What models do you plan to apply to your data first? 

*Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, (possibly) Heatmaps.*
